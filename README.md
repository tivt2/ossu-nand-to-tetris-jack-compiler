OSSU - nand to tetris part 2 - week 4 and 5 - Jack Compiler
This is my solution for these week project

Jack compiler is a software that receives as input a .jack file, and converts it to
.vm file containing VM commands to be further translated in binary.
The compiler works using a lexer and a parser to achive the a parse tree,
to be evaluated as vm commands.
